Welcome to galsampler's documentation
======================================

`galsampler <https://github.com/LSSTDESC/galsampler/>`__
is a Python package for making mock catalogs of galaxies using
`the GalSampler technique <https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.07340/>`__,
in which an existing catalog of mock galaxies is transferred
to the dark matter halos in a larger-volume simulation.
GalSampler was originally developed to generate the
`CosmoDC2 <https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06530/>`__ mock galaxy catalog
used by the Dark Energy Science Collaboration (`DESC <https://lsstdesc.org/>`__),
and is now being used to make mocks for the Emulator Mock Challenge
in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (`DESI <https://www.desi.lbl.gov/>`__).
